"""Evaluation for the recurrent agent.

Same structure as agents/dqn/dqn_eval.py, with the three changes the LSTM forces:
  - the recurrent state is threaded through the episode
  - prev_action / prev_reward are fed back into the network
  - prev_action = -1 marks the first step of an episode, which makes the
    network start from a zero state (same convention as training)

The env is built with eval=True, so rewards are NOT clipped and a lost life is
not an episode end. Training returns use clipped rewards, so for games whose
rewards are not just +-1 the two numbers differ; this is the one comparable to
the DQN and Rainbow eval numbers.

WHAT THE LSTM CHANGES, COMPARED TO dqn_eval.py
    1. The recurrent state (carry) is threaded from step to step, so the agent
       remembers what happened earlier in the episode.
    2. The previous action (one-hot) and previous reward are fed back into the
       network, as R2D2's architecture requires.
    3. prev_action = -1 marks the first step of an episode. The network reads
       that as "no previous action" and wipes its memory. This is the same
       convention the training collection loop uses, so an episode start looks
       identical in both places.
 
RETURNS
    episodic_returns        (eval_episodes,) unclipped return of each episode
    env_states_until_done   states of episode 0 up to its first done, for video
                            capture; None if the env does not expose them.
